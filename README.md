If you decide to make it so split bets, the user can bet on BOTH the cards instead of just one ->
make a AcknowledgeSplitResultActionRequest class and action that is performed on the AcknowledgeResult logic, and if the state is split and its the left card that was bet on,
dont progress the game and have the turn advance, instead
